# Colors from Los Angeles

A visual diary of my time in Los Angeles, capturing the vibrant energy, diverse people, and unforgettable moments that defined my journey in the City of Angels.

## About This Project

This project is an ongoing documentation of the dreams, relationships, and experiences that shaped who I am today. Los Angeles is a city of contrasts—glamorous yet gritty, sprawling yet intimate—and this work attempts to capture that complexity through moving images.

## The Inspiration

The video linked below represents the initial spark that inspired this larger project. It's a glimpse into the aesthetic and emotional tone I'm working to expand into a full visual narrative.

## Work in Progress

This is very much a living project. As I continue to revisit my footage and memories from Los Angeles, new themes and stories emerge. The goal is to create a comprehensive visual essay that honors the city and the people who made my time there meaningful.

## What's Next

I'm currently working on expanding this into a longer-form documentary that explores:

- The creative community and artistic spirit of LA
- The intersection of dreams and reality in a city built on both
- Personal growth and transformation through new environments
- The colors, textures, and rhythms that make Los Angeles unique
