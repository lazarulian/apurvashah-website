# Flow: A Visual Journey Through Japan

This photobook began as an observation of movement—how people navigate shared spaces in Tokyo versus American cities. What started as curiosity about social choreography became a meditation on consideration, space, and the invisible rules we follow.

## The Inspiration

Walking through Shibuya Crossing for the first time, I was struck by the silent coordination of thousands of people moving through the same space. There was no pushing, no rushing—just a gentle, collective flow. It made me question everything I thought I knew about personal space and social interaction.

## Contrasting Cultures

In America, we're taught to take up space, to assert ourselves, to make our presence known. But in Japan, I found the opposite—a culture built on the idea of making room for others, of moving through the world with intention and awareness.

## The Cherry Blossoms

The cherry blossoms became a metaphor for this entire experience. Like the blossoms drifting on the current, I found myself carried along by Tokyo's rhythm, learning to soften my edges and flow with the city rather than against it.

## The Photobook

This collection captures moments of that flow—the quiet consideration in crowded train stations, the choreography of pedestrians at intersections, the way light and shadow move through traditional gardens. Each image is an invitation to observe, to slow down, to notice the beauty in collective movement.
