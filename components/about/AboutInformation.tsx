          Hi everyone, I'm Apurva. I'm currently living in San Francisco, CA. In
          my free time, I enjoy backpacking, trying new foods, watching
          football, and reading new books.
          <br />
          <br />
          Some things that I am really passionate about are vegetarianism,
          improving my community, and social reform. If you are interested in
          talking with me about any of that or just want to grab a coffee,
          please reach out to me. I would love to get to know you üòÅ
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
