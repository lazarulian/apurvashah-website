            Hi everyone, I'm Apurva. I'm
            currently a Junior at UCLA studying Cognitive Science Specializing
            in Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy backpacking, trying new foods,

            Some things that I am really passionate about are vegetarianism, improving my community, and social reform. If you are interested in talking with me about any of that or just want to grab a coffee, please reach out to me.
