            Hi everyone, I'm Apurva. I'm
            currently studying in Los Angeles, CA. In my free time, I enjoy backpacking, trying new foods, 
            watching football, and reading new books.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Some things that I am really passionate about are vegetarianism, improving my community, and social reform. If you are interested in talking with me about any of that or just want to grab a coffee, please reach out to me.
            I would love to get to know you üòÅ
            <br />
            <br />
